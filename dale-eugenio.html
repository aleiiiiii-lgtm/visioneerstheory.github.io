      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <img src="dale.jpg" alt="Dale Eugenio">
      <p>
        My name is <strong>Dale Eugenio</strong>, a senior high school ABM student from Pasig. My main interests are basketball and cooking.
      </p>
      <p>
        I chose ABM because a close friend also did. Supporting each other boosted my confidence, and I realized ABM develops skills for my future.
      </p>
      <p>
        If I were not in ABM, my dream would be to become a firefighter. I admire their courage and discipline, which also guide me in achieving my future goals.
