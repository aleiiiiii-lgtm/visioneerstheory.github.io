    <p>
      My name is <strong>Dale Eugenio</strong>, a senior high school student in the ABM strand. 
      I grew up in Pasig, and my main interests are basketball and cooking.
    </p>

    <p>
      I chose the ABM strand because one of my closest friends also decided to take it. 
      Having someone I trust made me feel more confident in choosing this strand, since we 
      can support each other in our studies. Along the way, I also realized that ABM can 
      really help me develop skills that will be useful in my future.
    </p>

    <p>
      If I were not in the ABM strand, my wildest dream would be to become a firefighter. 
      I admire how they show courage, discipline, and sacrifice in saving lives during 
      emergencies. Even if my path is in ABM, I know that the same dedication and bravery 
      of a firefighter can also guide me in achieving my future goals.
