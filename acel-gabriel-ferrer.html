          Hi! My name is <strong>Acel Gabriel B. Ferrer</strong>, a Grade 12 ABM Senior High School Student 
          of Arellano University - Andres Bonifacio Campus. I am currently 17 years old and I live in 
          Nagpayong, Pinagbuhatan, Pasig City. I am the eldest among four brothers. My hobbies include 
          listening to music—Hip-hop, Pop, Rock, R&amp;B—and playing games like Left 4 Dead 2, Dead by Daylight, 
          and Mobile Legends. I also enjoy photography.
        </p>

        <p>
          I chose ABM because I love money! Hahaha. I enjoy counting money, and I want to be a Finance or 
          Marketing Supervisor, or something similar, when I finish college. Initially, I considered HUMSS 
          because I enjoy public speaking, but after learning that I’d be in a blended private school, 
          I decided ABM was a better choice. ABM helps me develop skills that will be useful in the future.
        </p>

        <p>
          If I were not in ABM, my wildest dream would be to pursue photography. I love capturing moments—big 
          or small—whether in my life or others’. Photography allows me to preserve memories and express 
          creativity while documenting the world around me.
