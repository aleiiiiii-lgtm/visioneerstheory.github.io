    <p>Hi! My name is Acel Gabriel B. Ferrer, a Grade 12 ABM Senior High School Student of Arellano University - Andres Bonifacio Campus. I am currently 17 years old and I live at Nagpayong, Pinagbuhatan, Pasig City. I am the eldest among four brothers. My hobbies include listening to music—Hiphop, Pop, Rock, R&B—and playing games like Left 4 Dead 2, Dead by Daylight, and Mobile Legends. I also enjoy photography.</p>

    <p>I chose ABM because I love money! Hahaha. I love counting money and I want to be a Finance/Marketing Supervisor or something similar when I finish college. Initially, I considered HUMSS because I enjoy public speaking, but after learning that I’d be in a blended private school, I decided ABM was a better choice. ABM helps me develop skills that will be useful in the future.</p>

    <p>If I were not in ABM, my wildest dream would be to pursue photography. I love capturing moments—big or small—whether in my life or others’. Photography allows me to preserve memories and express creativity while documenting the world around me.</p>
