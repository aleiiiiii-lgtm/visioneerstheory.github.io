      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <p>
        My name is <strong>Marjory B. Dugang</strong>, born on March 10, 2008, in Caloocan City. I currently live in Quezon City and I am a Grade 12 ABM student. I enjoy reading fiction, especially romance and fantasy, as well as non-fiction books related to science and mathematics. Sometimes, I paint or draw depending on my mood. My hobbies come from my curiosityâ€”I often wonder why the sun shines brightly or how stars exist.
      </p>
      <p>
        Growing up, I realized that I am easily influenced by my surroundingsâ€”people, books, or interesting things I find. One book influenced my strand choice; its main character, a brilliant CEO, inspired me. This led me to pursue ABM, which continues to shape my skills and aspirations.
      </p>
      <p>
        If I were not in ABM, my dream would be to become a scientist or pursue engineeringâ€”mechatronics, mechanical, or electrical fields. Exploring new paths excites me, and I aim to keep learning, growing, and reaching my fullest potential.
