    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Marjory B. Dugang, and I was born on March 10, 2008, in Caloocan City. 
      I currently live in Quezon City and I am a Grade 12 ABM student. I enjoy reading fiction, 
      especially romance and fantasy, as well as non-fiction books related to science and mathematics. 
      I also like watching documentaries and learning about history. Sometimes, I paint or draw, depending on my mood. 
      Most of my hobbies come from my curiosity—I often find myself questioning things like why the sun shines brightly, 
      how the stars exist, and other complicated matters. I love exploring ideas that challenge both my logical thinking and creativity.
    </p>

    <h2>My Journey</h2>
    <p>
      As I grew up, I realized that I am easily influenced by my surroundings—whether by people, 
      the books I read, or things I find interesting. One particular book I read became a major influence on my choice of strand. 
      Its main character, a brilliant CEO and business prodigy, fascinated me. I was inspired by his traits and the idea of success in the business world, 
      which is why I decided to pursue the ABM strand. So far, I am grateful for this choice, as it continues to shape my skills and aspirations.
    </p>

    <h2>My Wildest Dream</h2>
    <p>
      If I were not in ABM, my wildest dream would be to become a scientist or pursue engineering—whether in mechatronics, mechanical, or electrical fields. 
      The thought of exploring another world outside business excites me, as it would allow me to express my curiosity and ambition in new ways. 
      In the end, no matter what path I take, I aspire to keep learning, growing, and striving to reach my fullest potential.
