      My name is <strong>Marjory B. Dugang</strong>, and I was born on March 10, 2008, in Caloocan City. 
      I currently live in Quezon City and I am a Grade 12 ABM student. I enjoy reading fiction, especially 
      romance and fantasy, as well as non-fiction books related to science and mathematics. I also like 
      watching documentaries and learning about history. Sometimes, I paint or draw, depending on my mood. 
      Most of my hobbies come from my curiosityâ€”I often find myself questioning things like why the sun shines 
      brightly, how the stars exist, and other complicated matters. I love exploring ideas that challenge both 
      my logical thinking and creativity.

      As I grew up, I realized that I am easily influenced by my surroundingsâ€”whether by people, the books I read, 
      or things I find interesting. One particular book I read became a major influence on my choice of strand. 
      Its main character, a brilliant CEO and business prodigy, fascinated me. I was inspired by his traits and 
      the idea of success in the business world, which is why I decided to pursue the ABM strand. So far, I am 
      grateful for this choice, as it continues to shape my skills and aspirations.

      If I were not in ABM, my wildest dream would be to become a scientist or pursue engineeringâ€”whether in 
      mechatronics, mechanical, or electrical fields. The thought of exploring another world outside business 
      excites me, as it would allow me to express my curiosity and ambition in new ways. In the end, no matter 
      what path I take, I aspire to keep learning, growing, and striving to reach my fullest potential.
