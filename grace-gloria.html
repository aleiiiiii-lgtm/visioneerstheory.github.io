    <p>
      My name is <strong>Grace Gloria</strong>, and I grew up in Pasig.  
      One of my favorite hobbies is watching movies, especially K-dramas.  
      I enjoy them because they make me feel different emotions and sometimes inspire me in real life.  
      Watching shows and films is my way of relaxing and spending my free time.
    </p>

    <p>
      I chose the ABM strand because even though I am not very good at math,  
      I want to challenge myself and improve. I also wanted to be with my friends who chose the same strand,  
      so we can learn and support each other together.  
      I believe that ABM will help me gain knowledge and skills that I can use in the future.
    </p>

    <p>
      If I were not in ABM, my wildest dream would be to become a cook or a chef.  
      Cooking has always interested me because it is both fun and creative.  
      Preparing food for others and making them happy through it is something I would love to do.  
      In the end, whether in ABM or in the kitchen, I know that I will do my best and continue to grow as a person.
