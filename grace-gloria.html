    <p>My name is Grace Gloria, and I grew up in Pasig. One of my favorite hobbies is watching movies, especially K-dramas. I enjoy them because they make me feel different emotions and sometimes inspire me in real life. Watching shows and films is my way of relaxing and spending my free time.</p>

    <p>I chose the ABM strand because even though I am not very good at math, I want to challenge myself and improve. I also wanted to be with my friends who chose the same strand, so we can learn and support each other together. I believe that ABM will help me gain knowledge and skills that I can use in the future.</p>

    <p>If I were not in ABM, my wildest dream would be to become a cook or a chef. Cooking has always interested me because it is both fun and creative. Preparing food for others and making them happy through it is something I would love to do. In the end, whether in ABM or in the kitchen, I know that I will do my best and continue to grow as a person.</p>
