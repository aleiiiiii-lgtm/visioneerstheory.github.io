      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <p>
        My name is <strong>Grace Gloria</strong>, and I grew up in Pasig. One of my favorite hobbies is watching movies, especially K-dramas. I enjoy them because they evoke emotions and sometimes inspire me in real life. Watching shows is my way to relax and spend my free time.
      </p>
      <p>
        I chose the ABM strand even though Iâ€™m not very strong in math because I wanted to challenge myself and improve. Being with friends in the same strand also helps me learn and support each other. ABM helps me gain knowledge and skills for my future.
      </p>
      <p>
        If I were not in ABM, my dream would be to become a cook or chef. Cooking interests me because itâ€™s fun and creative. Preparing food for others and seeing them happy is something I love. In the end, whether in ABM or the kitchen, I aim to do my best and keep growing.
