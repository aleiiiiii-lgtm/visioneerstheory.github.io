    <p>
      My name is <strong>Fiona Nicole Nota</strong>, and I was born and raised in Pasig City.  
      I come from a family that constantly supports and inspires me to do my best in everything I pursue.  
      Outside of school, I enjoy singing and playing badminton. These hobbies allow me to balance both creativity and physical activity,  
      which help me express myself and maintain a healthy lifestyle.
    </p>

    <p>
      I chose the ABM strand because I would like to have my own business someday.  
      I believe ABM is the right track for me since it focuses on business, management, and leadership skills  
      that I know will be valuable in the future. Through this strand, I am learning how to be independent, responsible,  
      and more prepared for the career I want to achieve.
    </p>

    <p>
      If I were not in ABM, my wildest dream would be to explore a different path, but no matter what,  
      I would still want to pursue something that challenges me and helps me grow.  
      Deep down, I know that being an entrepreneur is where my passion lies, and it is the goal I will continue to work for.  
      In the end, my journey is about striving to build a life filled with purpose, success, and inspiration for others.
