      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <img src="fiona.jpg" alt="Fiona Nicole Nota">
      <p>
        My name is <strong>Fiona Nicole Nota</strong>, born and raised in Pasig City. I come from a supportive family that inspires me to do my best. Outside school, I enjoy singing and playing badminton, which balance my creativity and physical activity.
      </p>
      <p>
        I chose ABM because I want to have my own business someday. ABM focuses on business, management, and leadership skills, which I believe are valuable for my future. This strand helps me become independent, responsible, and prepared for my career.
      </p>
      <p>
        If I were not in ABM, my dream would be to explore a different path. Regardless, I would pursue challenges that help me grow. My passion lies in entrepreneurship, and I am committed to building a purposeful, successful, and inspiring life.
